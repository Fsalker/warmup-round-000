## Recipe
1. Start with a fresh bowl of `NodeJs`
2. Crack in enough `Express` flour & eggs so as to suffice your customers' appetite
3. Connect the `Mongoose` mixer into the `MongoDB` socket and mix until you get a homogenous composition
4. From time to time test that the batter is good with the special `Chai` spoon from your local `Mocha` market.
5. Add milk and watch it `React` with the composition.
6. Keep mixing and watch it `Redux` into a nice, gummy solution ready to be poured into the frying pan
7. Authenticate your pan into our `JWT` system and you might win one of our FREE 1.666.666 holiday trips to Moon in our raffle! 
(food, water, shelter, air and the space shuttle will however have to be acquired by your own means. We only assure you a clean, private interspacial path to Moon so as to not interfere with other spacial riders! Traffic has to be properly managed one way or another, right? Yeah, right...)
8. Turn on the stove and you're ready to go! For best results, `Test` that the front end of the pancake is mellow and puffy!

### Trivia

Always bake clean. Wash your hands in-between every step and use just as much of the ingredients as you need. This is the esoteric secret to being the best chef in the world!

Oh, and practice. Everyday. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlCRfTmBSGs. Real chefs had been studying and cooking for every single day until they became the best before being acknowledged as the top of the notch. Formal holidays are for lackeys, so keep going forward!
